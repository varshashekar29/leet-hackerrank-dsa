Important questions of Python:

ðŸ“Œ What is Python?
* High-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language
* Emphasizes readability and conciseness (uses indentation instead of braces)
* Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991

ðŸ“Œ Why Python?
Simple
    Clean, English-like syntax
    Minimal boilerplate â†’ focus on solving problems

Powerful
    Batteries-included standard library (web, file I/O, data handling, etc.)
    Vast ecosystem of third-party packages (NumPy, Pandas, Flask, Django, â€¦)

Flexible
    Multi-paradigm: procedural, object-oriented, functional
    Runs on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    Easy to embed in other apps or extend with C/C++

ðŸ“Œ How Python Runs Code

1) Variable:- A variable is a named memory location which is used to store the values and the values can be changed n number of times during execution.

2) What is a Datatype?
    Datatype means the type of data a variable holds.

3) Dynamic typing:- Dynamic typing means the type of a variable is determined at runtime (while the program is running), not when you write the code.

4)Why indentation matters in Python?
    "Python forces indentation to make code visually organized and logically correct."

5) Difference between Variables in Python vs C/Java
    Point	        C/Java	                                    Python
Typing	            Static typing (fixed type)  	    Dynamic typing (type changes)
Type Declaration	Must declare (int a = 5;)	        No need to declare (a = 5)
Type Change	        Not allowed (int cannot be string)	Allowed anytime
Compilation	        Compiler checks errors early	    Runtime checks
Memory Handling	    Variables hold memory address	    Variables reference objects
